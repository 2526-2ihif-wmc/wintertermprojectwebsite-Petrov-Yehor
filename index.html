                <h3 class="text-center mt-3 ms-5 mx-4">The Birth of a Legend</h3>
                <h6 class="text-center ms-5">(1946-1949)</h6>
                <p class="ms-5">On June 6, 1946, in New York City, a group of arena owners gathered to create something that would change sports forever. They founded the Basketball Association of America (BAA), not out of love for basketball, but out of necessity — they needed to fill their empty hockey arenas on off-nights.
          The first game took place on November 1, 1946, when the Toronto Huskies faced the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens. Tickets cost between 75 cents and $2.50. Nobody could have imagined this modest beginning would evolve into a multi-billion dollar global phenomenon.
          In 1949, the BAA merged with its rival, the National Basketball League (NBL), and the National Basketball Association was officially born. The league started with 17 teams, though many would fold in the coming years.
          The first dominant force emerged: George Mikan of the Minneapolis Lakers. Standing 6'10" with thick glasses, Mikan was so unstoppable that the league had to widen the lane from 6 to 12 feet just to limit his dominance. He led the Lakers to five championships and became basketball's first true superstar.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-4 px-4 mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-center mt-3 mx-4">The Foundation Years</h3>
                <h6 class="text-center">(1950s-1960s)</h6>
                <p class="m-2">The 1950s brought crucial changes that shaped modern basketball. In 1950, Earl Lloyd became the first African American to play in the NBA, breaking a barrier that would eventually transform the league's identity. In 1954, the 24-second shot clock was introduced, saving basketball from becoming a boring stall-fest and creating the fast-paced game we know today.
    This era witnessed the greatest individual rivalry in NBA history: Bill Russell versus Wilt Chamberlain. Russell, the ultimate winner, captured 11 championships in 13 seasons with the Boston Celtics — a feat that will never be repeated. Chamberlain, the ultimate statistical monster, once scored 100 points in a single game, a record that still stands and likely always will.
    The Celtics dynasty, led by Russell and coach Red Auerbach, dominated the decade with an iron fist. They won eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966, establishing Boston as basketball's most storied franchise.
    Other legends emerged: Bob Cousy revolutionized ball-handling, Oscar Robertson became the first triple-double machine, Jerry West's silhouette became the NBA logo, and Elgin Baylor invented the aerial, acrobatic style that would later define the game.

                <h6 class="text-center">(1970s)</h6>
                <p class="me-5">The 1970s were turbulent times for the NBA. A rival league, the American Basketball Association (ABA), emerged with a flashier style, a red-white-blue ball, and the three-point line. Stars like Julius Erving, known as "Dr. J," brought an artistic, above-the-rim game that captivated fans.
    In 1976, the leagues merged, with four ABA teams joining the NBA: the Nets, Nuggets, Pacers, and Spurs. The merger brought new talent and innovations, including the three-point shot.
    Despite these additions, the NBA struggled. Drug problems plagued the league, attendance dropped, and television ratings plummeted. By the late 1970s, NBA Finals games were being broadcast on tape delay after the late news. The league desperately needed saviors.
    They arrived in 1979.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center mt-3 mx-4">Magic and Bird Save the NBA</h3>
                <h6 class="text-center mx-5">(1980s)</h6>
                <p class="ms-5">The 1979 NBA Draft delivered two rookies who would rescue professional basketball: Earvin "Magic" Johnson went to the Los Angeles Lakers, and Larry Bird joined the Boston Celtics. Their rivalry — the flashy showman from Michigan versus the hard-working kid from Indiana, Los Angeles versus Boston, Showtime versus blue-collar grit — captivated America.
Magic, at 6'9", played point guard with a smile that lit up arenas. His no-look passes and fast-break dunks created "Showtime" in Los Angeles. Bird, meanwhile, talked trash, worked harder than anyone, and hit clutch shots with ice in his veins. Together, they revived the Lakers-Celtics rivalry and brought the NBA back to prime-time television.
They met in the Finals three times (1984, 1985, 1987), with the drama intensifying each meeting. Their mutual respect grew into friendship, but their competition pushed both to greatness.
Behind them, a new generation prepared to take over. In 1984, the Chicago Bulls drafted a skinny guard from North Carolina named Michael Jordan.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-4 px-4 mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-center mt-3 mx-4">The Jordan Era</h3>
                <h6 class="text-center">(1990s)</h6>
                <p class="m-2">Michael Jordan didn't just play basketball — he transcended it. With his aerial acrobatics, killer instinct, and unmatched competitiveness, Jordan became the most famous athlete on the planet.
His Chicago Bulls, coached by Phil Jackson and featuring the versatile Scottie Pippen, won six championships in eight years (1991-93, 1996-98). Jordan won Finals MVP every single time. He never let a championship series go to a Game 7. When the pressure was highest, Jordan was at his best.
The numbers tell only part of the story: five regular-season MVPs, ten scoring titles, a career average of 30.1 points per game. But Jordan's impact went beyond statistics. He made basketball global. His Air Jordan sneakers became cultural icons. His "Be Like Mike" commercials made children everywhere dream of flying.
His signature moments are etched in history: "The Shot" over Craig Ehlo, the "Flu Game" where he dominated while sick, and "The Last Shot" — his final basket as a Bull, a championship-winning jumper over Bryon Russell.
When Jordan retired (temporarily) in 1993, the Houston Rockets and Hakeem Olajuwon seized their chance, winning back-to-back titles. But when Jordan returned with "I'm back," he reclaimed his throne immediately.

                <h6 class="text-center mx-5">(2000s)</h6>
                <p class="me-5">The 2000s began with a new dynasty: the Los Angeles Lakers. Shaquille O'Neal, the most physically dominant center ever, and Kobe Bryant, Jordan's heir apparent, formed an unstoppable duo. They won three consecutive championships (2000-2002), with Shaq earning Finals MVP each time.
But egos clashed. Shaq wanted more shots; Kobe wanted to be "the man." Their cold war eventually led to Shaq's departure to Miami, where he won another title with Dwyane Wade in 2006.
Kobe stayed in Los Angeles, determined to prove he could win without Shaq. He scored 81 points in a single game — second only to Wilt's 100 — and eventually led the Lakers to two more championships (2009, 2010).
Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs emerged as the decade's most consistent team. Tim Duncan, the "Big Fundamental," along with Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, won four titles with a boring-but-brilliant style that prioritized teamwork over individual glory.
In 2003, an 18-year-old from Akron, Ohio, entered the league with impossible expectations. LeBron James was called "The Chosen One" before he played a single NBA game. He would spend the next two decades proving the hype was justified.

                <h6 class="text-center mx-5">(2010s)</h6>
                <p class="ms-5">LeBron James' 2010 decision to leave Cleveland for Miami — announced in a live television special called "The Decision" — became the most controversial moment in NBA history. Fans burned his jerseys. His reputation took a massive hit.
But LeBron had a plan. Teaming with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, he formed a superteam that reached four consecutive Finals, winning two championships (2012, 2013). The villain became a champion.
In 2014, LeBron returned to Cleveland with unfinished business. Two years later, he delivered the impossible: trailing 3-1 to the historically great Golden State Warriors (who had won 73 games that season), LeBron led Cleveland to three straight victories. His block on Andre Iguodala in the final minutes of Game 7 is one of basketball's most iconic plays. Cleveland won its first major sports championship in 52 years. LeBron wept on the court.
The Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, revolutionized basketball with their three-point shooting. Curry, once considered too small and injury-prone, became a two-time MVP and changed how the game is played. Teams now shoot more threes than ever before because of him.
When Kevin Durant joined the Warriors in 2016, they became nearly unbeatable, winning two more championships (2017, 2018). The league scrambled to compete with their firepower.

                <h6 class="text-center mx-5">(2020s)</h6>
                <p class="ms-5">The 2020s have brought new stars and new stories. LeBron James, now with the Lakers, won his fourth championship in 2020 (in the COVID bubble) and passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in 2023.
Giannis Antetokounmpo, the "Greek Freak" who came from poverty in Athens, led Milwaukee to the 2021 championship with a historically dominant Finals performance. His story — from selling goods on the streets to NBA champion — embodies basketball's global reach.
Nikola Jokić, a second-round pick from Serbia, became the first center to win three MVP awards while playing a style never seen before: a 7-footer who passes like Magic Johnson. He led Denver to their first championship in 2023.
The Boston Celtics reclaimed glory in 2024, winning their 18th championship — more than any other franchise.
And the future has arrived: Victor Wembanyama, a 7'4" French phenomenon with guard skills and center size, represents the next evolution of basketball. The game continues to grow, innovate, and inspire.
From those humble beginnings in 1946 to today's global spectacle watched by billions, the NBA's journey reflects the power of competition, the magic of teamwork, and the eternal human desire to fly.
